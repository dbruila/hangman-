Hello! Let's play!

The computer thinks out a word - 
displays the first and last letter 
of the word and marks the places for 
the remaining letters with strokes.

The player suggests a letter that can 
be included in this word. If such a 
letter is in a word, then the computer 
inserts it over the lines corresponding 
to this letter - as many times as it occurs 
in the word. If there is no such letter, 
then the computer starts drawing a 
picture. The player continues to 
guess the letters until he guesses the whole 
word. For each wrong answer,
the computer adds
one or some lines to the picture 
(there are 8 elements).

If the picture is completely drawn, 
the player loses. If the player manages to 
guess the word, he wins.
